  "description": "Dear EHR Ops,\r\n\r\nAt UIC we have received the initial OMOP-transformed EHR files from our EHR-only partner, UnityPoint. For context, during our 1-on-1 in April, we decided that we wanted a way to submit these files separately from the files that came from our own, local, EHR records, in the event that the QC feedback needs to be substantively different. Could you please advise on the best technical way to submit these files? We had discussed a separate google bucket, to which the UIC data stewards would have access. If this is still acceptable, please let us know the best way to request this bucket (or access it if it is already created).\r\nThank you,\r\nChristine Jovanovic",

  "description": "This is not a new issue for my site, it's just never been resolved. Both numerator and denominators for data transfer metrics never match what is expected or reflective of the source data submitted in the EHR ETL. NIH Metrics Dashboard says refresh occurred 6/3/2022 and has 347 participants in the numerator, but the person table I submitted contains 725 patients. I need better support about this than I've received to date, because clearly something is not adding up.  Additionally, the denominators never match what I'd expect to see in HealthPro. Data transfer rate A, for example, counts more than 1,000 eligible participants while there's less than a 1,000 participants paired to HealthPartners at all (the numbers related to HealthPro participants will never quite match since Tableau Dashboard seems to refresh HealthPro related data daily, but numbers are drastically different). This is not a new issue, a ticket was submitted last February but I believe other issues drowned this one out. However, this issue is incredibly important to resolve now, so please help. ",

We are going through and triaging each site's room for improvement for data quality ahead of the Q3 submission- as this will be the big one.\n\nThe main two things we identified for your site for this cycle is: (1) Improving the GC-1 Rate, particularly for OMOP tables Drug & Procedure (2) to submit Physical Measurements (we are missing these).\n\nCould you please take a look at the following two zendesk articles and make changes needed. Let us know if we can help.\n\nFor GC-1 (https://aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012365822-NIH-Grant-Award-Metrics-)\nFor Physical Measurements (https://aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012365842-Physical-measurements)\n\nThanks, Nripendra",

We understand transmitting the notes is a requirement of the program and consent exists for this \u2013 nevertheless clarifying this is helpful for the process on our site.\r\n\r\nWe have the following questions concerning the NLP pipeline:\r\n\r\n1.\tCan you confirm that the process will extract concepts from the notes submitted, and only these concepts are included in the DRC data repository? Or, does the process remove identifiers from text and the remaining text is included in the data repository?\r\n2.\tAre there evaluation metrics on the NLP pipeline that will be used and if so can you please share these metrics with us? If the pipeline/algorithms are published, a reference to publication would be helpful.\r\n3.\tWill the notes uploaded by sites be used to train the NLP algorithms or to do any other machine learning / AI-related activities? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAna Holzbach\r\n",

  "description": "Hi EHR Ops,\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed our results.html report from 6/20/22 and can confirm we can fix the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  We'll drop the \"errors\" folder from our submission\r\n  2.  We can remove duplicate table keys in the specimen table\r\n  3.  Achilles Heel Errors 413, 713, and 813\r\n\r\nBefore we resubmit, however, we have a few questions about some other triggers in the report:\r\n\r\n  1.  We received a warning that we had 1452 records where \"EHR person record exists but no PII Name record.\" Could you explain what this means? I checked, and none of our CDM tables contain a person_id that's not also in the pii_name table.\r\n  2.  There are some participants who have multiple MRNs in our system. This can happen when the patient is mistakenly registered another another spelling of their name, or when another fact about them is entered as missing instead of correctly (for instance, SSN all 9s or zip code missing). This results in duplicate person_id records in our pii_mrn table. Is this acceptable?\r\n  3.  Similar to above, when patients are given multiple MRNs due to different name spellings, they will get multiple rows in the pii_name table. Is this acceptable, or should we defer to the spelling collected by study staff?\r\n  4.  We have 16 participants whose dates of birth are unknown, so we have year_of_birth populated with \"0\" and I believe it's triggering the Achilles Heel Error 3 for year of birth < 1800. How should we proceed?\r\n  5.  I ran the query suggested on the Zendesk for our Achilles Heel Error 700, and don't find any drug_concept_id in our drug_exposure table that aren't in the \"Drug\" domain. However, we do have 53 distinct concept IDs that aren't \"standard.\" Should we map these to 0?\r\n  6.  We have many records where is \"0\" because the concept ID isn't standard. Specifically, this applies to ICD-10-CM U07.1 and U09.9 which are related to COVID. Should we keep these as 0? Since there are so many of these records, it's contributing to our \"missingness\" rate.\r\n  7.  Another thing we noticed is that some of our most common \"conditions\" that don't have maps to standard concept IDs in their original coding language do\u200b have maps to standard concept IDs in other vocabularies. For instance, ICD-10-CM code F17.210 \"Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated\" appears in 1,374 records in our condition_occurrence table, but has a condition_concept_id of \"0\" because the corresponding concept ID (1568179) isn't standard. However, according to athena, F17.210 maps to SNOMED 56294008 (ID 4209423), which is a standard concept. Should we use this concept instead, even though it's not in the same vocabulary as the source?\r\n\r\nIf it would be more helpful to set up a meeting, please send your availability.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nAshey\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: EHR Ops <noreply@researchallofus.org>\r\nSent: Monday, June 20, 2022 20:17\r\nTo: Ashley Martinez <Ashley_I_Martinez@rush.edu>; David Sedillo <David_Sedillo@rush.edu>\r\nCc: curation@aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com <curation@aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com>\r\nSubject: EHR Data Submission Report for Rush University\r\n\r\nRush Email Security\r\n\r\n**WARNING** This email originated from outside of Rush University Medical Center. **DO NOT CLICK* links or attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.

You can use this query here to find the invalid concept_ids: https://aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012365822-NIH-Grant-Award-Metrics-\n\n\n    SELECT COUNT(*) AS condition_total_rowFROM `condition_occurrence`;SELECT COUNT(*) AS condition_well_defined_rowFROM `condition_occurrence` coLEFT JOIN `concept` c ON co.condition_concept_id = c.concept_idWHERE standard_concept=\"S\" and domain_id=\"Condition\";\n\n\nWould you be able to investigate why these concept_ids are invalid and make a fix?\n\nThanks,\nChun Yee",

The content is split into the NIH Award Dashboard and this EHR Ops General Data Quality Dashboard.\n\n \n\nWe will incorporate the different types of invalid consents into the dashboard so it will function as before. A zendesk ticket is created and we will follow up on this request.\n\n \n\n \n\nBest,\n\nZoey\n\nFrom: Wolfe, Keri Ann <keri.a.wolfe@vumc.org>\nDate: Friday, June 24, 2022 at 12:29 PM\nTo: Mike Audet <maudet@mitre.org>, Jiang, Xinzhuo <xj2193@cumc.columbia.edu>, Natarajan, Karthik <kn2174@cumc.columbia.edu>\nCc: Franziska Moeckel <fmoeckel@mitre.org>, Michele C.

(it currently has a red alert even if the participant was valid and consented at the time of the upload but withdrew after the upload) in the EHR ops dashboard it was a yellow alert if the participant withdrew after the upload (so a valid upload but they need to be removed from future uploads).  The yellow or red alerts require very different actions\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMichael Audet\n\n \n\nClinical Quality and Informatics Department\n\nHealth Transformation Technical Center\n\nThe MITRE Corporation\n\nMobile: (571) 369-8059 | email: maudet@mitre.org\n\n \n\nFrom: Wolfe, Keri Ann <keri.a.wolfe@vumc.org>\nSent: Thursday, June 23, 2022 3:12 PM\nTo: Wolfe, Keri Ann <keri.a.wolfe@vumc.org>\nSubject: [EXT] Release: EHR Ops General Data Quality Dashboard\n\n \n\nHello everyone,\n\n \n\nThe new 'EHR Ops General Data Quality Dashboard' (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com_-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Fdrc.aouanalytics.org-252F-2523-252Fviews-252FEHROpsGeneralDataQualityDashboard-252FHome-253F-253Aiid-253D2-2526-253Alinktarget-253D-5Fblank-26data-3D05-257C01-257Ckeri.a.wolfe-2540vumc.org-257Cac3da4ef016d4aa5e16408da555b6f88-257Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab-257C0-257C0-257C637916148461229996-257CUnknown-257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0-253D-257C3000-257C-257C-257C-26sdata-3D5OZZYmPYSe4l2F-252BICRfece-252BLvHft7-252F3Fr4WzIOenud0-253D-26reserved-3D0&d=DwMFAg&c=G2MiLlal7SXE3PeSnG8W6_JBU6FcdVjSsBSbw6gcR0VzYHa0heH42N3FCy53AEIz&r=iTq9SPccpdIl8gFxosxTbmuKELQUiehqBwzzror0fvo&m=ifwGDHvDrQV_pzZxDVMVudYjCZGE-yU2n9ycFXREos2DfJA1O2gGsFCRXstrB3DO&s=ui0Xh2pcK16rV9REh05LkFJjaCkgiE8c_c3c5xi0zxk&e=) was released. Some important notes:  \n\n* It replaces the previously named EHR Ops Dashboard \n\n* It is designed to accompany the 'NIH Grant Award Metrics' Dashboard released a couple weeks ago. \n\n* This dashboard is designed to highlight the data quality focus for each quarter. \n\nUpdates: \n\n* The landing page now states the data quality focus for each quarter, as well as the days remaining in the submission cycle. Each data quality focus has an arrow-button that will navigate the user to the relevant dashboard view when clicked. Each data quality focus also has an info button that will open the relevant EHR Ops Zendesk article pertaining the metric in a new tab. \n\n \n\n* The physical measurements tab of the above dashboard now includes a completeness metric for blood pressure. The tooltip then indicates the completeness percentage for all blood pressure metrics, systolic, and diastolic separately. \n\n \n\n \n\n* The src_hpo_id are added to show the metrics for each submission site.\n\n \n\n \n\nKeri Wolfe, MS\n\nManager, AOU Analytics\n\nAll of Us Research Program, Data and Research Center (DRC)\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center \n\n \n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

  "description": "Hi,\n\n \n\nWe received files from Spectrum and tried to upload them to the google bucket using: gsutil -m cp -r [YYYY-MM-DD-V#] gs://[hpo-site-bucket]. It works fine in previous uploads. But, this time, the upload failed with the note below.\n\nI tried the different way: gsutil -o GSUtil:parallel_composite_upload_threshold=150M cp bigfile gs://your-bucket. It didn\u2019t work for me. Do you have any suggestion to upload big file(s)?\n\n \n\n \n\nNOTE: You are uploading one or more large file(s), which would run significantly faster if you enable parallel composite uploads. This feature can be enabled by editing the \"parallel_composite_upload_threshold\" value in your .boto configuration file. However, note that if you do this large files will be uploaded as 'composite objects https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/composite-objects'_, which means that any user who downloads such objects will need to have a compiled crcmod installed (see \"gsutil help crcmod\"). This is because without a compiled crcmod, computing checksums on composite objects is so slow that gsutil disables downloads of composite objects.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nYong\n\n \n\n\n-------------------------------\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email contains information from the sender that may be CONFIDENTIAL, LEGALLY PRIVILEGED, PROPRIETARY or otherwise protected from disclosure.

  "description": "Hi Christian and Christine,\n\nNice to meet both of you. I am not sure there is a lot of documentation floating around the NIH/ NIH working group regarding data transfer rate C, but I am happy to discuss it and share some context...certainly for the parts our team has been involved with.\n\nHow is this Thursday 7/14 at 2pm ET or next Tuesday 7/19 at either 3pm ET or 4pm ET?\n\nAnd with regards to the API Ops flags, there is another team that handles this; however, they usually do not directly meet/interact with sites- so I am happy to reach out to them with any questions you may have.\n\nThanks,\nNripendra\n________________________________\nFrom: Udu, Christian <cudu@uic.edu>\nSent: Monday, July 11, 2022 2:19 PM\nTo: Acharya, Nripendra D. <na2960@cumc.columbia.edu>\nCc: Jovanovic, Christine <cjovanov@uic.edu>; Hambright, Suzanne <shambrig@uic.edu>\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] EHR Transfer Rates and Rationale\n\n\nGood Afternoon Nripendra,\n\n\n\nI hope you are doing well. My name is Christian and I work as a biomedical informatics lead at UIC\u2019s All of Us Research Program. My supervisor Christine Jovanovic works as a Director of Research Operations. We both started about the same time in early May, so we are getting acquainted with the data, data collection methods, and various research tasks. We are looking to adapt the Data Transfer Rate C in our upcoming EHR Quarterly Transfer and Site-Specific Transfers, but we are finding difficulty finding historical information in how transfer rates were calculated in the past. We also had some questions on how this came to be and the significance of particular flags for data transfers. Would you be open to scheduling a zoom meeting with us to discuss the Transfer Rate C and the API Ops flags? If you are available, please feel free to send us some date and times.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nChristian Udu, MPH\n\nHe/Him\n\nBiomedical Informatics Research Specialist, All of Us\n\nInstitute for Minority Health Research\n\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago.\n\nE: cudu@uic.edu<mailto:cudu@uic.edu> | O: 312-413-3568",

I know given Banner's large amount of participants this can be a bit tricky to keep track of.\n\nAbout a week ago this number was 200+, but it look like this week this has shot way down to 63. I wanted to reach out and see if it would be helpful to discuss either the metric/ ways we could help mitigate this. Does your team manually check healthpro or use the API?

They say they are seeing ~1100 participants that qualify while they believe only ~600 should be.  \n\nThey also have 2 example PIDs that they confirm they transferred EHR records for, but are showing as EHR Transfer Status = No: P37232160 and P352468932\n\nI will ask the RDR what info we have for those two ppts.\n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nDrew Ericson\nAssociate IT Business Analyst\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, Data and Research Center\n\n2525 West End Ave | Nashville, TN 37203\nEmail: DRCSupport@vumc.org\nWebsite: allofus.nih.gov (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fallofus.nih.gov%2F&data=04%7C01%7Candrew.ericson%40vumc.org%7C4ed19401bd144c1c7cb108d8fdbeb174%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C637538342741761599%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LDSiPzUW%2FxDQbkJY8vwBtkthcL1h1Jy2iZVXMOJsMYY%3D&reserved=0)",

During this time, would you please email the data quality focuses for Q4 (once they are established) directly to Dr. Jason Vassy (cc\u2019d)? We will make a submission as soon as we can once staff return in the winter.\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns. We hope to make a submission for Q3 by the end of the month and look forward to your feedback.\n\n \n\nThank you!\n\nCassie",

I hope you are doing great. FYI, I am out today and tomorrow and Kasie will be out whole week.\n\n \n\nThis being said, I've just checked the link that you've shared and saw that error and warning (adding the screenshot below). \n\n \n\nI've also downloaded the most recent data from the HealthPro website few moments ago and checked all of the participant IDs that we've sent on our last submission against the list of participants with both EHR and General consents but couldn't find the one that didn't have an EHR consent during that time(6/30/2022). I've found the one that withdrawn after our data submission though. Can this be an error on the control script maybe?\n\n \n\nIf Michael can send us the mentioned PMI ID we might be able to dig deeper.\n\n \n\nThank you again for all your helps.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\nOsman Turkes\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOsman S.

This does not automatically mean there was a privacy issue it may just be a matter of timing\n\n \n\nI copied Michael Tokarz from the DRC on this email as I\u2019m hoping he can tell us the correct process to get the PID of the participant so you can investigate\n\n \n\nMichael Tokarz,\n\n               Can you please let us know the process for Cooperative Health to get the PID of the participant that wasn\u2019t consented so they can investigate the issue?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMichael Audet\n\n \n\nClinical Quality and Informatics Department\n\nHealth Transformation Technical Center\n\nThe MITRE Corporation\n\nMobile: (571) 369-8059 | email: maudet@mitre.org\n\n \n\nFrom: Kasie M.

As a reminder, the EHR Dashboard for NIH Grant Award Metrics is located here.

The existing EHR Consent column of the NIH Grant Award Metrics has now been updated to capture different types of EHR consent and withdrawal issues. Similar to the previous dashboard's design EHR consent issues are summed in the first view, and then broken into multiple categories in the tooltip. \n\n \n\n1. Within the tooltip, the number of 'Red' Issues are broken down: which includes the # participants who have not given EHR Consent but were submitted & the number of participants who withdrew prior to submission (but were still submitted). The 'Yellow' Issues indicate the # of participants who have withdrawn since the last submission. 'Green' indicates no issues. \n\nIf you have questions, please let us know.\n\nThank you,\n\nLizzie Stewart\nAssociate IT Project Manager\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, VICTR\n2525 West End Ave, Suite 600 | Nashville, TN 37203\nPhone: 615-875-6803\nEmail: Lizzie.Stewart@vumc.org\nWebsite: https://victr.vumc.org/ (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictr.vumc.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Clizzie.stewart%40vumc.org%7Cecfd148ac59942139fbc08da612536ac%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C637929109710658229%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZuJE0b4%2FNYO9M%2FrW21NpgXgjwYW8XC2nlQUDvfLgSw0%3D&reserved=0)\n\n \n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

The existing EHR Consent column of the NIH Grant Award Metrics has now been updated to capture different types of EHR consent and withdrawal issues. Similar to the previous dashboard's design EHR consent issues are summed in the first view, and then broken into multiple categories in the tooltip. \n\n \n\n1. Within the tooltip, the number of 'Red' Issues are broken down: which includes the # participants who have not given EHR Consent but were submitted & the number of participants who withdrew prior to submission (but were still submitted). The 'Yellow' Issues indicate the # of participants who have withdrawn since the last submission. 'Green' indicates no issues. \n\nIf you have questions, please let us know.\n\nThank you,\n\nLizzie Stewart\nAssociate IT Project Manager\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, VICTR\n2525 West End Ave, Suite 600 | Nashville, TN 37203\nPhone: 615-875-6803\nEmail: Lizzie.Stewart@vumc.org\nWebsite: https://victr.vumc.org/ (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictr.vumc.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Clizzie.stewart%40vumc.org%7Cecfd148ac59942139fbc08da612536ac%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C637929109710658229%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZuJE0b4%2FNYO9M%2FrW21NpgXgjwYW8XC2nlQUDvfLgSw0%3D&reserved=0)\n\n \n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

  "description": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI am with SEEC and we are working with our partners at UM to bring their physical measurement counts up for Refresh 16. Current their height, weight, bp, and hr are all at 73%. It seems that this is due to them enrolling patients who are seen in their Jackson facility. Because of the way their health system works, this would make these participants eligible for patient status=yes, but the UM EHR system only has access to the billing information for these visits while the health records themselves stay locked in the Jackson system. Essentially these are empty placeholder visits in the UM EHR system. We believe the best and most accurate way to resolve this is to change these participants patient status to 'no' and not send the records for these participants. We wanted to see if the DRC agrees with this approach. We appreciate your assistance and feedback with this issue and the sooner we get an answer back to UM the sooner they can resubmit data to SEEC for processing.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDonny Weinbrenner",

  "description": "ZenDesk contains conflicting information about what concept IDs to map to for required measurements/labs. I need to confirm the correct code list because I've already had to re-map from SNOMED ancestor to LOINC to conform to ambiguous DRC feedback. Now when I look at the 'Missing Lab Components' -- it's saved as an attachment -- under my site I see completely different values from what is listed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18J3LFQ_kqSt9xyAEKY45EECZWs0BOhBPhUDQZ5Mv8UA/edit#gid=0. You need to reconcile this for me ASAP because it affects Q3 metrics and I frankly think poor DRC support via ZenDesk is to blame. It's not respectful to any site to have 4+ different articles related to measurements, especially when those articles don't even provide consistent information. I just need the right code list to use. Please escalate this.",

I was going through some zendesk tickets and saw we had some outstanding items to discuss. Jake - I think it might be easier to address some of these on a call, so we can also check we are not missing anything. I'll wrangle all the tickets I can find and put them in one place - if there are other things that come top of mind that we ought to discuss, please let me know.\n\n\n\nCould we schedule a 1:1 at one of the following times:\n\n  *   Thursday at 12:30 pm ET, 3:30 pm ET, or 5pm ET\n  *   Friday at 4:30 pm ET\n\nAppreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nNripendra\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nThis e-mail and any files transmitted with it are confidential and are intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.

I\u2019m working on UCSD\u2019s All of Us OMOP extract.  I sat in the EHR Ops call yesterday.  The hot topic was data quality for EHR submissions.   You mentioned data quality for new contributors.  And the word \u201cnew\u201d caught my attention.\n\n\n\nUCSD lost quite a bit of domain knowledge after losing a key employee.  I\u2019m filling in for her with varying success.  I\u2019m fairly new to the EHR submission process.  And I\u2019m facing a 25/75 scenario on documented procedure vs tribal knowledge (respectively).\n\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking it may be easier to start over.\n\n\n\nAgain, going back to that phrase \u201cnew contributors\u201d \u2026  I think UCSD will have the best success in continuing the submission process by rebuilding from the ground up.  I\u2019m hopeful that we can do so as though we\u2019re a new institution joining the program.  Is there someone I can talk to about this?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\nBrian Fox\n\nInformation Systems Analyst\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Informatics\n\nbefox@health.ucsd.edu<mailto:befox@health.ucsd.edu>\n\nBiomedical Research Facility II (BRF2), 5A20\n\nON CAMPUS: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays\n\nWORKING REMOTELY:   Tuesdays and Fridays",

Could you confirm whether this is just a delay in the dashboards or if there was an issue with our submission?\n\n \n\nThank you!\n\n \n\nCassie Hanson\n\nSenior Data Manager, All of Us Research Program\n\nVA Boston Healthcare System\n\n150 S Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02130",

  "description": "Hello, this is Matthew Phad with Spectrum Health (TACH).\r\nOn our submission from 8/16, Roger and I noticed that we dropped to 0% Heart Rate measurements in the Physical Measurements tab. We believe this is because we were mapping our Pulses to a SNOWMED code not in the concept ID set you list here (https://aou-ehr-ops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012365842-Physical-measurements). \r\nSubsequently, we re-mapped our Pulses to the Heart Rate concept ID 3027018 (listed in the concept ID set you check against). This re-mapping is reflected in our latest submission (from 8/24), but the Physical Measurements tab still shows us at 0% for Heart Rate. Roger and I have both checked the data we sent and are confident that we have many measurements with the concept ID 3027018. \r\nI'm curious if it is possible that the General DQD and the NIH Metrics dashboard are ever out of sync? The NIH dashboard correctly says our latest submission is from 8/24, but is it possible the General DQD has not refreshed with that data yet?\r\nIf not is it possible that something is wrong with the Physical Measurements check?\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. If there is an issue on our end, we would like to get it fixed and re-submit before 8/30. But, Roger and I are both confident that we have records in our measurement table that should be counting towards Heart Rate, which is why we are looking for any insight you can provide here. \r\n\r\nThanks!",

  "description": "Hello,\n\n \n\nI would like to confirm that we have submitted the OMOP tables for Unity Point. Has the system determined success? We usually get a system confirmation within a few hours for our other Google buckets, but the Google bucket for UnityPoint has not been received. Could you look to see if aou824 is paired to UnityPoint and if the results for curation? I am not able to use pull any results on my end.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, the primary data team is not receiving notifications for submission, which usually occurs a few hours after loading. Could you add me (the data steward for UIC) and Christine Jovanovic (the director of research operations) to the email list notifications for future uploads? The primary Google buckets we would need notifications for are The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC: aou336), Unity Point (aou824), and Cook County.\n\n \n\nThank you,\n\nChristian\n\n \n\n \n\n---\n\nChristian Udu, MPH\n\nHe/Him\n\nBiomedical Informatics Research Specialist, All of Us\n\nInstitute for Minority Health Research\n\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago.\n\nE: cudu@uic.edu | O: 312-413-3568",

It would be helpful for us to know when these sites might be launching. I only knew UNC was preparing b/c of my work with their informatics folks in N3C.\n\nBefore a site can request a Google bucket to make submissions, we ask them to run this local file checker<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fall-of-us%2Faou-ehr-file-check&data=05%7C01%7Ccl3777%40cumc.columbia.edu%7C5de9b8e183cb4c08d07b08da8a9b2f4b%7Cb0002a9b0017404d97dc3d3bab09be81%7C1%7C0%7C637974696361828458%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bSBajsemsT0FsZSdy8ou5FVjRiDWawOo0kZbwNVCHS0%3D&reserved=0> and provide its output to us. In an ideal situation, we set up a 1:1 onboarding meeting with the site even before they send us the output file. During that meeting we trying to understand the site\u2019s general data infrastructure, including EHR vendor(s) they use.\n\nIf we know a site is within a month of launch, it would be helpful for us prep them for EHR submissions.\n\nThanks\nK\n\n\n\nFrom: Lopez-Class, Maria (NIH/OD) [E] <maria.lopez-class@nih.gov<mailto:maria.lopez-class@nih.gov>>\nDate: Tuesday, August 30, 2022 at 10:17 AM\nTo: Natarajan, Karthik <kn2174@cumc.columbia.edu<mailto:kn2174@cumc.columbia.edu>>, Kayla Marginean <kayla.marginean@vumc.org<mailto:kayla.marginean@vumc.org>>, Schulkey, Claire (NIH/OD) [E] <claire.schulkey@nih.gov<mailto:claire.schulkey@nih.gov>>, shimonrura@verily.com<mailto:shimonrura@verily.com> <shimonrura@verily.com<mailto:shimonrura@verily.com>>\nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL] Re: Contact for EHR sprints prior to new RMC launches?\nThank  you for this information Karthik,\n\nCan you specify what is being asked of new institutions to assess their readiness related to EHR? I know in the past they had to make sure they conducted EHR sprints.\n\nI am working with both UCLA and UNC and I want to be sure they will be in compliance with their EHR submissions prior to launch. Hence, the need to understand how I can best assess launch readiness for these institutions.\n\nThank  you,\nMaria",

We already contribute EHR data on a quarterly basis, in OMOP format, but placing it in the assigned Google bucket.\n\n\n\nMarshfield has had their own \u201chome grown\u201d EHR systems for years, but it is currently undergoing a conversion to Cerner.  Some of our sites are live under Cerner, while others are not.  In the AoU participant portal, we noticed that under \u201cFind your provider\u201d (to share EHR data) one of our sites (Beaver Dam) is showing up.  We are curious how/why this site is showing up, while other sites that are live on Cerner are not showing up.  We realize this has something to do with Cerner configuration on our side, but would also like to know what is set up on your side for this provider (or other providers) to show up.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n\n\nThe contents of this message may contain private, protected and/or privileged information.

  "description": "This is a follow-up to your previous request #748 \"AoU Q2 2022 Data Submission\"\n\nQuestion for you. For orders, in Epic there is an order type of charges. I am trying to figure out the best domain for these orders. Taking a look at the CPT procedure category, I am seeing values like 'occupational therapy charges' which says this is a charge for the patient visit and same with physical therapy. But but another CPT procedure category like cancer care charges have procedure name of chemotherapy. Should the ones describing a visit be mapped to the visit domain?\n\n \n\nLisa Mallinger\n\nSr. Programmer Analyst II\n\nEnterprise Data Warehouse\n\nNorthShore University HealthSystem\n\nOffice: 224--7475\n\nEmail: lmallinger@northshore.org",

I honestly have no idea if that is an issue or not, but I'm curious why the accepted concept IDs are not concepts in the Measurement domain?\r\nAgain, I really don't know if that truly presents an issue, and changing it means we'd likely have to change mappings on our side, I'm just asking about the process behind selecting those codes.

I figured I would start this thread, so I could go ahead and attach the mis-mapped drugs we spotted on the first call.\n\nToday we can go over the condition table - but both measures are for GC-1. Thanks\n\nTalk soon,\nNripendra\nrush_mismapped_drugs_gc_1.csv",

  "description": "Hi Prasanth,\n\nHope you are well. Just wanted to send you a quick note - we were looking at Alliance Chicago's GC-1 with Amro on Tuesday and it looks like the dip in their measurement table GC-1 is from Alliance-paired participant data submitted by Northwestern.\n\nBut this was all in the measurement table, and it was the 0s issue we talked about during the Northwestern meeting last week - so once you have updated this it should be good to go. Just thought I would bring it to your attention.\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\nNripendra",
