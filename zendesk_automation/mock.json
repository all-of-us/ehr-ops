For example, with Cooper Green, I wanted to look at PMIDs with the most recent EHR receipt date of 3/31/22, however HealthPro shows 3/18/22, then it jumps to 4/18/22, and finally to the most recent date of 4/25/22. I\u2019ve noticed this with a few other sites in the Southern Network as well. Is the new OMOP version overwriting old upload dates?

  "description": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI am with SEEC and we are working with our partners at UM to bring their physical measurement counts up for Refresh 16. Current their height, weight, bp, and hr are all at 73%. It seems that this is due to them enrolling patients who are seen in their Jackson facility. Because of the way their health system works, this would make these participants eligible for patient status=yes, but the UM EHR system only has access to the billing information for these visits while the health records themselves stay locked in the Jackson system. Essentially these are empty placeholder visits in the UM EHR system. We believe the best and most accurate way to resolve this is to change these participants patient status to 'no' and not send the records for these participants. We wanted to see if the DRC agrees with this approach. We appreciate your assistance and feedback with this issue and the sooner we get an answer back to UM the sooner they can resubmit data to SEEC for processing.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDonny Weinbrenner",

  "description": "Hello,\n\n \n\nI would like to confirm that we have submitted the OMOP tables for Unity Point. Has the system determined success? We usually get a system confirmation within a few hours for our other Google buckets, but the Google bucket for UnityPoint has not been received. Could you look to see if aou824 is paired to UnityPoint and if the results for curation? I am not able to use pull any results on my end.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, the primary data team is not receiving notifications for submission, which usually occurs a few hours after loading. Could you add me (the data steward for UIC) and Christine Jovanovic (the director of research operations) to the email list notifications for future uploads? The primary Google buckets we would need notifications for are The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC: aou336), Unity Point (aou824), and Cook County.\n\n \n\nThank you,\n\nChristian\n\n \n\n \n\n---\n\nChristian Udu, MPH\n\nHe/Him\n\nBiomedical Informatics Research Specialist, All of Us\n\nInstitute for Minority Health Research\n\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago.\n\nE: cudu@uic.edu | O: 312-413-3568",

We already contribute EHR data on a quarterly basis, in OMOP format, but placing it in the assigned Google bucket.\n\n\n\nMarshfield has had their own \u201chome grown\u201d EHR systems for years, but it is currently undergoing a conversion to Cerner.  Some of our sites are live under Cerner, while others are not.  In the AoU participant portal, we noticed that under \u201cFind your provider\u201d (to share EHR data) one of our sites (Beaver Dam) is showing up.  We are curious how/why this site is showing up, while other sites that are live on Cerner are not showing up.  We realize this has something to do with Cerner configuration on our side, but would also like to know what is set up on your side for this provider (or other providers) to show up.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nRob\n\n\n\nThe contents of this message may contain private, protected and/or privileged information.

I am needing to get him added to the pertinent EHR-related calls (biweekly EHR Ops on Tuesdays and the EPIC Working Group Meeting on Wednesdays).

If there are additional meetings I missed that would be beneficial for Ardem to attend, please add him to those as well.\n\n \n\nLet me know if you have questions or concerns.\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\nMichelle Sikkink, MPH (she/her/hers)\n\nResearch and Evaluation Specialist\n\nEssentia Institute of Rural Health\n\nResearch Operations | Maildrop: 6AV-2\n\n502 East 2nd Street, Duluth, MN 55805\n\nP: 218-786-2509 | F: 218-727-8159\n\nMichelle.Sikkink@EssentiaHealth.org | www.essentiainstitute.org (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.essentiainstitute.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cmichael.tokarz%40vumc.org%7Cd84ddfbec0164ac15f1208daa88e35ec%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C638007625985736478%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mSuYBMzwrdc7KYqpHHZPFddsk4xDrEfQcLK5vXPOc%2BQ%3D&reserved=0)\n\n \n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

  "description": "This is a follow-up to your previous request #748 \"AoU Q2 2022 Data Submission\"\n\nQuestion for you. For orders, in Epic there is an order type of charges. I am trying to figure out the best domain for these orders. Taking a look at the CPT procedure category, I am seeing values like 'occupational therapy charges' which says this is a charge for the patient visit and same with physical therapy. But but another CPT procedure category like cancer care charges have procedure name of chemotherapy. Should the ones describing a visit be mapped to the visit domain?\n\n \n\nLisa Mallinger\n\nSr. Programmer Analyst II\n\nEnterprise Data Warehouse\n\nNorthShore University HealthSystem\n\nOffice: 224--7475\n\nEmail: lmallinger@northshore.org",

I honestly have no idea if that is an issue or not, but I'm curious why the accepted concept IDs are not concepts in the Measurement domain?\r\nAgain, I really don't know if that truly presents an issue, and changing it means we'd likely have to change mappings on our side, I'm just asking about the process behind selecting those codes.

Just wanted to send you a quick note - we were looking at Alliance Chicago's GC-1 with Amro on Tuesday and it looks like the dip in their measurement table GC-1 is from Alliance-paired participant data submitted by Northwestern.\n\nBut this was all in the measurement table, and it was the 0s issue we talked about during the Northwestern meeting last week - so once you have updated this it should be good to go. Just thought I would bring it to your attention.\n\nThanks!\n\nBest,\nNripendra",

  "description": "This is a follow-up to your previous request #1146 \"RE: [AoU] Re: SMART ON FHIR...\"\n\nHi Tan,\n\n \n\nJust following up on this and looking for some confirmation. The Cerner endpoint (url) that is launched from the AoU portal (EHR Sharing) is found in the public GitHub repo below, correct? And Cerner maintains this, correct? Or does Care Evolution?\n\n \n\nWe created a service record (ticket) with Cerner because patients (AoU recruits) cannot log into Cerner when attempting to share their EHR data from the AoU Portal. But the feedback we\u2019ve received so far seems to indicate that Cerner link is for internal provider use and not patient use. We are just trying to confirm who provides/maintains the link to Cerner when launched from the AoU Participant portal.\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\nRob",

  "description": "I'm sure this was already stated but in the event that it was not. \r\n\r\nI was able to find in our data the missing concept id's for the missing \"Lab Component Inclusion Rate\" on the \"Measurement Integration\" tab. Most of the missing components for the sites seem to be a \"branch\" off of the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel or CMP. \r\n\r\nThis being said I'm not sure how much medical coding that the data people of other groups have had. But knowing that I've had some blockages with this and other sites had these same concepts missing as well I can only assume maybe they are not bringing in these concepts because lack of medical knowledge? \r\n\r\nAnyway, a simple answer to this is to look in the data for CMP test being done and the 14 separate measurements attached to this CMP.  https://www.testing.com/tests/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp/\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps someone. Please let me know if you need additional information and maybe we can address it in our next meeting? ",

The LSU Health Network is now discontinuing use of Allscripts and is migrating to use of UMC\u2019s Epic instance. Ultimately, this will allow easier and more complete uploads to AoU for those who enroll in AoU via the LSU Health Network. However, during the transition, we may be NOT able to upload EMR-derived data for those who enrolled via the LSU Health Network.\n\n \n\nThis issue does not affect those who enrolled through UMC and, therefore, does not create any problems for the UMC portion of the data upload. But for those who enrolled via the LSU Health Network, our plan is to temporarily change the \u201cPatient Status\u201d values to \u201cNO ACCESS\u201d for the LSU Health Network enrollees during the above-mentioned transition from Allscripts to Epic. Once we are in a position to do, so we will change the \u201cPatient Status\u201d values for those enrollees back to the original values entered into AllScripts back (\u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d),\n\n \n\nThis affects our current LSU data upload, and on Tuesday (Nov 15), I only upload the UMC portion of the data.\n\n \n\nI have had Dr. Miele\u2019s approval for changing the statuses of LSU Health Network participants to NO ACCESS and would like to inform you before doing it on HealthPro by the end of today .\n\n \n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nSan Chu\n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

For example, when looking at \u201cEligible Participants with EHR\u201d I\u2019m counting any participant that has an EHR status = PRESENT in the PDR. When I do that, I\u2019m getting a different number than that reported on the dashboard. Is there any additional logic that goes into arriving at the counts listed? Also are you querying the PDR to produce these counts or some other source?\n\n \n\nIf you would be willing to share the logic and fields used to arrive at these 3 counts it would be appreciated.\n\n \n\nThank you!\n\n \n\n \n\nLuke Shaffer\n\nThe MITRE Corporation\n\nSenior Economic Business Analyst\n\nlshaffer@mitre.org\n\nC: (571) 389-2427",

I do not know why the denominator is so much greater than what we have in HealthPro. \n\n \n\nMatt and Sandra- I do not know if this would be a question for Dr. Cimino, but I am wanting to verify that the denominator= \"Participant Status- Core Participant\" and \"Patient Status- Yes\". I ran this search again today and it is now 1146 (which is due to the continuing changes we are making to rectify our records).\n\nIs it possible that the DRC is using a different definition to obtain the denominator? \n\n \n\nRegards, \n\nBlaire Williams, MSN, RN, CNL\n\nAll Of Us Project Manager I\n\nTulane University School of Medicine \n\nLA CaTS Clinical Translational Unit \n\n1440 Canal Street, Suite 1712E\n\nNew Orleans, LA 70112\n\nPhone: 504-988-9074\n\n \n\n \n\n\u200b\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFrom: Sweat, Chance E <csweat@tulane.edu>\nSent: Thursday, November 17, 2022 10:14 AM\nTo: Williams, Blaire A <bwilliams7@tulane.edu>; Fonseca, Vivian A <vfonseca@tulane.edu>\nCc: Callegari, Emily <ecallegari@tulane.edu>; McDuffie, Roberta H <rmcduffi@tulane.edu>\nSubject: AoU EHR Ops Dashboard\n\n \n\nBlaire \u2013 the data rates showing in the dashboard for us don\u2019t match what I\u2019m getting from you for the denominator and San at Pennington for the numerator. I\u2019m guessing this is part of what Sandra was looking at this week.\n\n \n\nSan said she had ~600 in the numerator this week, and you mentioned that we\u2019re down to ~1200 as \u201cEHR=Yes\u201d in HealthPro. The dashboard shows us at 368/2436 as the numerator/denominator. From what I\u2019m hearing, we should be at 50% (still much lower than we should be) but much better than what the DRC shows.\n\n \n\nNot sure what you want to do with that information, but it jumped out at me when I had a minute to look this morning.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChance Sweat\n\nManager, Data Science & Analysis\n\nTulane University Medical Group (TUMG)\n\nP: (504) 988-8448 | E: csweat@tulane.edu\n\nPlease consider the environment before printing.\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE TO RECIPIENT: This email transmission, including attachments, if any, is intended for use only by the addressee(s) named herein and contains confidential information and/or protected health information that may be protected by federal law.

Additionally, Allise reviewed the HealthPro work queue this morning which stated that 1878 core and core minus PM participants had their data shared on 11/23/22.

We are using Snowflake, and plan to eventually set up a process to transfer data directly from Snowflake to the google bucket; however, in the meantime, Roger and I were planning to upload data by pulling it down from Snowflake, and uploading directly to the bucket. I attempted to do this yesterday by dragging and dropping the files in my browser, but the upload process didn\u2019t finish (6 files didn\u2019t upload).\n\n \n\nI\u2019m now hoping to set up a process using google cloud SDK, but am having some trouble getting things set up. Is there someone at the DRC (or perhaps I should reach out to the AoU Ops team?) that would be able to walk me through setting up google cloud SDK in order to effectively upload our data?\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if setting up a meeting to accomplish this would be possible. Thanks in advance!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMatthew Phad\n\n(He/him/his)\n\nData Scientist\n\n \n\n100 Michigan Street NE | MC001\n\nGrand Rapids, MI 49503\n\n \n\nc.   815.545.9274\n\nw.  spectrumhealth.org\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n[ WARNING : This email came from an external source.

I work in ITS for the VP/Chief Data and Analytics Officer\u2019s office.\n\n \n\nI am helping Yale University School of Medicine prepare for participation in the All of Us genomics project, which we hope to quickly implement with the January arrival of Dr Lucila Ohno-Machado.\n\nShe will remain a lead researcher, grantee, and sponsor of All of Us carrying over her roles from UCSD.\n\nThe CDAO\u2019s span is helping setup as much in advance as possible.\n\n \n\nWe are at the point where our InfoSec resources are conducting a Security Review of the transmission of All of Us data down to Vanderbilt\u2019s repository.\n\nMost of their questions are about the format, transmission methods, and security config at VUMC.\n\n \n\nCould you please help me connect with someone who can speak to those questions and if possible directly correspond with Yale InfoSec?\n\n \n\nSincere apologies for the cold-call; I couldn\u2019t find a specific security contact in the directory pages.\n\n \n\nMany thanks for your time and help!\n\n \n\nWith warm holiday wishes,\n\nMike\n\n \n\nMike Stutzman, MFA, MAEd\nITS Team Lead \u2013 Office of the VP-CDAO\n\n\nInformation Technology Services\n789 Howard Avenue\n\nNew Haven, CT 06519-1300\n\n(Quinnipiac, Paugussett, & Wappinger territories)\n\n \n\nPhone: 475-210-2463\n\nEmail: michael.stutzman@ynhh.org\n\n \n\nGet your medical records online!

  "description": "Hi EHR Ops team!\n\n \n\nChristine asked DRC Support a question about how a participant who enrolled through their institution but was not a patient of their hospital system. She said the participant would need to share his/her EHR through the Care Evolution platform and she was wondering how this would affect their pairing status at their HPO.\n\n \n\nI don\u2019t believe this should have any bearing on the pairing status, but I was unsure about the general CE EHR Sharing process, so I wanted to reach out to you all to see if you happened to have a high-level explanation of the process that a participant who originates from the PTSC Portal would then share their EHR via the CE pathway. If you don\u2019t I can reach out to CE directly, but I would think all EHR data would come through y\u2019all at some point. \n\n \n\nI believe that the only thing that would affect anything would be if the ppt signed up via the CE Pathway, but this is not the case.\n\n \n\nThanks for your help!\n\n \n\nDrew Ericson\nAssociate IT Business Analyst\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, Data and Research Center\n2525 West End Ave | Nashville, TN 37203\nEmail: andrew.ericson@vumc.org\nWebsite: allofus.nih.gov (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fallofus.nih.gov%2F&data=04%7C01%7Candrew.ericson%40vumc.org%7C4ed19401bd144c1c7cb108d8fdbeb174%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C637538342741761599%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LDSiPzUW%2FxDQbkJY8vwBtkthcL1h1Jy2iZVXMOJsMYY%3D&reserved=0)\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom: DRC Support\nSent: Thursday, December 22, 2022 10:20 AM\nTo: Russo, Christine A. <CRUSSO@MGH.HARVARD.EDU>\nSubject: RE: Inquiry About Non-Patient Participants Sharing EHR\n\n \n\nHi Christine, thank you for that thorough explanation of your question! That was very helpful in my understanding of the issue at hand.\n\n \n\nSo, my understanding of what lets the HPO locate the participant in PMT is the specific pathway through which the participant enters the program. For example, If the participant completes enrollment and consents (etc) through the PTSC\u2019s Participant Portal, then you should be able to locate the participant on PMT. This is because PMT and the PTSC Portal are both managed by the PTSC.\n\n \n\nIf the participant completes enrollment via the Care Evolution Portal and signs consents (etc) through that platform, you would be unable to locate the participant on PMT, because CE and PMT are managed by different organizations.\n\n \n\nSo, I believe that, provided the participant originates via the PTSC platform (Which would be the standard HPO workflow), they should be visible in PMT. However, I am unsure about the EHR sharing portion specifically, so I will pass that portion of your question along to our EHR Ops team to get their input.\n\n \n\nFor any additional questions you may have about PMT, please reach out to the PTSC, as they are best equipped to address the specifics.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nDrew Ericson\nAssociate IT Business Analyst\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, Data and Research Center\n\n2525 West End Ave | Nashville, TN 37203\nEmail: DRCSupport@vumc.org\nWebsite: allofus.nih.gov (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fallofus.nih.gov%2F&data=04%7C01%7Candrew.ericson%40vumc.org%7C4ed19401bd144c1c7cb108d8fdbeb174%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C637538342741761599%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LDSiPzUW%2FxDQbkJY8vwBtkthcL1h1Jy2iZVXMOJsMYY%3D&reserved=0)\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFrom: Russo, Christine A. <CRUSSO@MGH.HARVARD.EDU>\nSent: Thursday, December 22, 2022 9:37 AM\nTo: DRC Support <drcsupport@vumc.org>\nSubject: Inquiry About Non-Patient Participants Sharing EHR\n\n \n\nGood Morning,\n\n \n\nI was hoping to get some clarity about the process in which Participants who are not Patients with our New England HPO are able to share their EHR.\n\n \n\nIf a participant joins through the HPO websites (joinallofus.org or joinallofus.org/new-england), but they do not have EHR with our Mass General Brigham Institutions, when they consent to EHR and are taken through the CareEvolution path of sharing their records, will Our New England Team still be able to locate them in PMT / Pair them with our Organization and Sites?\n\n \n\nI suppose there is some confusion on whether it is OK for to Participants to share EHR through CareEvolution and still be paired with us. I have received information about Participants joining through the Direct Volunteer sites (go.joinallofus.org), sharing EHR through CareEvolution, and then we cannot find the Pt in PMT or pair them (since they signed up as DV).\n\n \n\nCould you confirm/clarify that Participants joining through the regular/our HPO websites can share their EHR through CareEvolution and still be paired with out HPO and Sites? (I understand if this would not be the case through DV website, as we have encountered it before).\n\n \n\nAny information you can provide, or perhaps directing me to the correct contact with this question, would be greatly appreciated.\n\n \n\nThank you and best regards,\n\n-Christine Russo\n\nOperations Project Manager All of Us New England\n\n \n\n \n\nChristine Russo (she/her/hers)\n\nClinical Research Program/Project Manager\n\nAll of Us Research Program (https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fallofus.nih.gov%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cdrcsupport%40vumc.org%7C2d8ab52abb1f424303b508dae432519e%7Cef57503014244ed8b83c12c533d879ab%7C0%7C0%7C638073202026554443%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=jzi%2FV8sotA1Hnrm3UE9s%2BSXeqbeU5w239ZCmXGYQfwo%3D&reserved=0)   | Mass General Brigham\n\ncrusso@mgh.harvard.edu |617-768-8300\n\n65 Landsdowne St., Cambridge, MA 02139\n\n \n\nThe information in this e-mail is intended only for the person to whom it is addressed.

  "description": "Hi Ryan,\n\n \n\nI am looking at HealthPro API to see which participants we were not able to transfer with patient status \u201cYes\u201d. I wanted to investigate into the status, but from the HealthPro API I can only see the variable \u201cisEHRDataAvailable\u201d. However, when looking at the variable, all participants are marked as \u201cFALSE\u201d or \u201cUNSET\u201d in our database. Is there a place on the dashboard(s) where we could find Patient Status \u201cYes\u201d and EHR Transfer \u201cNo\u201d? And if so, are there sets of variables that could reflected the totals on HealthPro?\n\n \n\nNripendra and Chun Yee \u2013 My apologies for not following up on this sooner as it has been long since our last conversation when looking into this. If you would like, please feel free to answer this as well.  \n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nChristian\n\n \n\n \n\n---\n\nChristian Udu, MPH\n\nHe/Him\n\nBiomedical Informatics Research Specialist, All of Us\n\nInstitute for Minority Health Research\n\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago.\n\nE: cudu@uic.edu | O: 312-413-3568",
